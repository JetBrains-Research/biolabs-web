    <h1>Peak Calling Solution</h1>

<div id="description-block">
    <p>
        The peak calling routine presents a significant challenge in working with large scale human epigenetic data:
        while ULI-Chip-seq protocol generally allows for robust peak calling, it is considerably more variable than
        the conventional
        Chip-seq approach. Accurately dissecting the situation when both background and signal can vary is generally
        a prohibitively complex task for the unbiased peak calling approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
        We propose the novel semi-supervised approach to peak calling.
        Fast and effective semi-supervised peaks analyzer <a
            href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/span" target="_blank">SPAN Peak
        Analyzer</a> is a multipurpose peak caller capable of
        processing both conventional and ULI-Chip-seq tracks.
        In the semi-supervised approach, the user annotates a handful of locations as peaks, valleys, or peak shores,
        and then uses these annotations to train the model that is optimal for a
        given sample.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the major challenges of semi-supervised learning is the procedural complexity of the manual
        annotation of the data, which often leads to inaccuracies and mix-ups. We created a brand new visualization
        tool
        that would support classical genome browser capabilities and provide readily accessible integrated peak
        annotation
        and peak calling capabilities.
        <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/jbr" target="_blank">JBR Genome
            Browser</a> allows one to upload tracks of the Chip-seq data and perform on-the-fly annotation
        and peak calling for a given annotation, where results of the peak calling are immediately visualized as BED
        files
        in the same session. It can serve not only as an efficient semi-supervised peak calling engine but also as a
        next-generation genome browser. It provides enhanced capabilities of viewing large files, observing multiple
        locations simultaneously, and gathering track statistics.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/span" target="_blank">SPAN Peak
        Analyzer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/jbr"
                            target="_blank">JBR Genome Browser</a> can be used separately as
    general-purpose peak caller and genome browser, respectively. However, together, they can serve as a
    complete solution for peak calling.
    The semi-supervised peak calling approach is capable of improving peaks consistency in datasets with different
    signal-to-noise ratio,
    as well as obtaining the best peak calling results for individual samples.
